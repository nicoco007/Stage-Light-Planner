The gray bar icon is a batten, and the `Label` allows you to place arbitrary text anywhere on the plan. To edit a fixture, batten, or label's properties, click on it.\r\n\r\n## Editing fixtures\r\nTo create, edit, or delete a fixture, go to `Tools > Fixture Editor`. There, you can edit or delete existing fixtures, create your own, and sort them by name.\r\n\r\n![Fixture Editor](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/49088008/slp/fixture-editor.png)\r\n\r\n# Getting more help\r\nIf you need help, start by taking a look at the [user manual](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/49088008/slp/manual.pdf).
